        OLX Europe shares public API for its partners. It allows to easily integrate with local sites by posting, managing adverts and communicating with OLX users via internal messaging system. API documentation is the same for every OLX across the Europe.

        To help you get started, this is API calls collection to be used with Postman.

        [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/3bf2713b8a249cdd917c)

        # Versioning
        * Major version is reserved for completely new version or redesigned API
        * Minor version is for potentially backward incompatible changes (e.g. field is removed/added/changed name, etc)
        * We do not support “bugfix” part of the versioning as minor versioning is enough in this case - if bugfix has backward incompatible change, it will bump up minor version.
        * Version is defined using Version header (e.g. If you want to use endpoint in version 2.0, just send request with header “Version: 2.0”).
        * Version header is required.

        # Language
        * In multilingual countries (like Ukraine) switching between languages is supported by sending header “Accept-Language: xx” where xx is language code
        * There are two endpoints exposing available languages and currencies (see endpoints references below).


        # Authentication

        ## OAuth 2.0

        OLX API implements OAuth2 standard. For more information you can visit https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/definitions/.

        Basic principle of OAuth is one point of authorization and accessing all of resources with access token, granting (or not) access to certain endpoints.

        OAuth access token is string which should be passed to every request made to OLX API endpoints. Token is valid for certain amount of time, after that application have to send request with refresh token to receive new token.

        **Remember** Access token is like password - when someone obtains token, then gains full access to given account, limited only by token scope.

        In order to use API partner should request to receive API Client data. One partner may have more than one application eligible for OLX API, each with different set of credentials. Basic API credentials are `client_id` and `client_secret` - both are required regardless of selected authentication method.

        ## Credentials

        Please store `client_id`, `client_secret` in safe place, as it will be needed to complete configuration and authentication process.

        ## How to obtain Access Token

        In order to receive token, client should send POST request to `/api/open/oauth/token`. Required fields:
        ```
        {
          "grant_type": "",
          "client_id": "",
          "client_secret": "",
          "scope": "v2 read write"
        }
        ```
        `client_id` and `client_secret` are data you have received from OLX business person. `scope` is requested token scope, but limited by partner settings - basically “v2”, “read” and “write”.

        Depends on grant type, request should contain other necessary fields.

        As response client will receive:
        ```
        {
          "access_token": "454c3cd39a980500e9b787e03d53ec5c320f644b",
          "expires_in": 86400,
          "token_type": "bearer",
          "scope": "v2 read write",
          "refresh_token": "12a13560163da7901d7f74c89fc5df3ea7625942"
        }
        ```
        Access token should be passed with each request to API as header Authorization.

        `Authorization: Bearer 454c3cd39a980500e9b787e03d53ec5c320f644b`

        Field `expires_in` defines how many more seconds since now (now = last request to oauth/token endpoint) access token will be valid.

        Refresh token is valid for one month (2592000 seconds). Also it can be changed when new access token is generated.

        Please store access token and refresh token in safe place.

        ## Supported grant types
        |Grant Type         |Context       |Actions                                      |
        |-------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
        |authorization_code |User          |Add or fetch adverts adverts / messages, etc.|
        |client_credentials |Client        |Fetch config data: categories, cities, etc.  |
        |refresh_token      |User or Client|                                             |

        ## Scopes

        Scopes are specific permissions for API usage as a given user type. The authorization and token endpoints allow your application to specify the scope of the access request.

        Each API endpoint can demand access token with the specific scope. See the endpoint reference for information about required scope.

        Please note your application has closed list of allowed scopes, so you should ensure you are able to ask about given scope and always verify the scopes of issued token.

        Default scopes are: v2 read write.

        ## Grant type: authorization_code

        **Requirements:**

        Client must specify Callback URL. You can specify more than one Callback URL. Please avoid special chars like `&` (multiple), `#` in Callback URL.

        **Flow:**

        On Application site user clicks on button “Authenticate with OLX”.

        Auth URL: /oauth/authorize/?client_id=XXX&response_type=code&state=XXX&scope=read write v2&redirect_uri=XXX

        Parameter `state` is optional. It will be returned in step 4 so application can validate if response is not crafted by someone else.

        Parameter `redirect_uri` is optional if you specified only one Callback URL. If you have more than one Callback URL parameter `redirect_uri` is mandatory. Please avoid special chars like `&` (multiple), `#` in redirect_uri.

        URL will be used in step 4. `redirect_uri` should base on defined earlier Callback URL.

        Example:

        Callback URL: http://myadomain.com/auth/connect

        Auth URL: https://www.olx.pt/oauth/authorize/?client_id=123&response_type=code&state=x93ld3v&scope=read+write+v2&redirect_uri=http://myadomain.com/auth/connect

        Example 2:

        Callback URL: http://myadomain.com/auth/connect

        Auth URL: https://www.olx.pt/oauth/authorize/?client_id=123&response_type=code&state=x93ld3v&scope=read+write+v2

        If you have only one Callback URL you don’t have to pass `redirect_uri` parameter.

        User is redirected to OLX login screen
        User logs in and authorize client
        User is redirected back to `redirect_uri` with some additional query parameters: `code` and `state` (optional).

        Example: http://myadomain.com/auth/connect?code=d34feg43g456g&state=x93ld3v

        Application exchange received `code` to access token by grant type `authorization_code`.

        Request to get access token, sent to `/api/open/oauth/token` endpoint, should have:
        ```
        {
          "grant_type": "authorization_code",
          "client_id": "",
          "client_secret": "",
          "code": "",
          "scope": "v2 read write",
          "redirect_uri": "http://myadomain.com/auth/connect"
        }
        ```
        Note: `redirect_uri` parameter is optional unless you use parameter `redirect_uri` in Auth URL in step 1. If you use `redirect_uri` in step 1, then `redirect_uri` is also mandatory in request in step 5.

        ## Grant type: refresh_token - when access token is expired

        When access token expires use saved refresh token to acquire new access token.

        Refresh token is special token used to obtain new access token without need to authorization with user credentials again.

        Notice: refresh token is valid only for one month (2592000 seconds).

        Request to refresh access token, sent to `/api/open/oauth/token` endpoint, should have:
        ```
        {
          "grant_type": "refresh_token",
          "client_id": "",
          "client_secret": "",
          "refresh_token": ""
        }
        ```
        
        New access token will be issued.
            
        Refresh Token Response:
        * A new refresh token will be issued. We issue a new refresh token each day, so if the token was issued that day, the most recent token will be returned.
        * Since the refresh token's validity is one month, you should store the new refresh token and use it in your subsequent requests. 
        * If the refresh token is not used for a month, it will be invalidated and you will need to re-authenticate the user.

        Please store access token and refresh token and keep it in safe place.

        ## Grant type: client_credentials - authenticate as Client application

        Required fields:
        ```
        {
          "grant_type": "client_credentials",
          "client_id": "",
          "client_secret": "",
          "scope": "v2 read write"
        }
        ```
        Now you’re logged in with Client application context. You can obtain list of categories, cities, etc. (but not add advert!). To perform actions on user account you must use other grant type and log in with User context.

        ## Access token usage

        From now on all request to any API endpoints should be performed with authorization header: Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN.

        Example:
        ```
        curl -X POST -H “Content-Type: application/json” -d ‘{ data }’ -H “Authorization: Bearer 011c945f30ce2cbafc452f39840f025693339c42” -H “Version: 2.0” “https://www.olx.pt/api/partner/adverts”
        ```
        ## Application with multiple OLX users

        **Overview**

        Lets say you have your application that has its own users and each user needs to manage his olx account (post adverts, reply to messages etc.). Flow is actually no different than for single user.
        * Your app has client_id and client_secret
        * Your app user needs to connect his account to OLX and in return he will get code
        * Code is used one time only to get access_token and refresh token
        * Your app user is authenticated with access_token until it gets expired
        * Your app user gets new access_token by using refresh token

        As you see this is exactly the same as you would have single user. As soon as user is authenticated, OLX API works in context of that user.

        **Obtaining client_id and client_secret**

        As you already know, you get it by filling online form. If your request is accepted you will get them by email.

        **Connecting app user account to OLX**

        Usually on your app there will be a button “connect olx account” or it can be done on authentication itself “login with olx” or something similar. This action is connected with uri:
        ```
        /oauth/authorize/?client_id=XXX&response_type=code&state=XXX&redirect_uri=XXX&scope=read write v2
        ```

        `client_id` - your app client id that you got by email

        `response_type` - is set to “code”, that is oauth 2.0 standard

        `state` - is your random hash that you need to save for the time of request, when you get response with state you need to check if it is the same as your saved one just to be sure that it is correct response (and there is no one in the middle trying to give you false secret data)

        `redirect_uri` - is the uri where response with code will be sent

        `scope` - is the scope you ask for, typically it is “read write v2”

        Whenever user triggers that uri, he/she is redirected to OLX login page (or account if is already logged in) and after authentication and accepting application connection is redirected back to redirect_uri with code and state.

        `code` - is one time authorization token

        `scope` - is the scope that you sent on request Example: http://myadomain.com/auth?code=d34feg43g456g&state=x93ld3v

        **Getting access_token and refresh_token for user**

        Now, finally you can get user api credentials that will be used for API authentication. Your app needs to make POST request for that:
        ```
        POST /api/open/oauth/token

        {
          "grant_type": "authorization_code",
          "client_id": "<your client_id>",
          "client_secret": "<your client_secret>",
          "code": "<code from previous action>",
          "scope": "v2 read write"
        }
        ```
        In response you will get user data:
        ```
        {
          "access_token": "454c3cd39a980500e9b787e03d53ec5c320f644b",
          "expires_in": 86400,
          "token_type": "bearer",
          "scope": "v2 read write",
          "refresh_token": "12a13560163da7901d7f74c89fc5df3ea7625942"
        }
        ```
        `acccess_token` - is a token that user will user to authenticate with API

        `expires_in` - indicates when access_token will expire

        `token_type` - is always set to bearer, this means that access_token will be sent in every request header as Bearer <access_token>

        `scope` - is your requested scope, typically “v2 read write”

        `refresh_token` - is a token that will be needed to refresh expired access_token. Token is valid for one month (2592000 seconds).

        From now on you will add to each api request of that user a header “Authorization: Bearer 454c3cd39a980500e9b787e03d53ec5c320f644b”. You need to store securly each user’s access_token and refresh_token. Whenever your app user will authenticate to your app and manage olx account, you will use this data for OLX API requests.
        Refreshing access_token with refresh_token

        Every period of time access_token will expire. When it does you need to make call to refresh it (and get new one).
        ```
        POST /api/open/oauth/token
        {
          "grant_type": "refresh_token",
          "client_id": "<your client_id>",
          "client_secret": "<your client_secret>",
          "refresh_token": "<your user's refresh_token>"
        }
        ```
        `grant_type` - is set to “refresh_token”, which means user is refreshing access_token with refresh_token

        `client_id`, client_secret - are your app secrets

        `refresh_token` - is your app user’s refresh_token that you got for him in previous requests.

        Response depends on state of access token:

        * when access token is expired, in response client will receive new access token.
        * if token was not expired yet, client will receive same token, with information about remaining time left.

        Notice: refresh token is valid for one month (2592000 seconds). Also it can be changed when new access token is generated.

        You need to update access and refresh token in your database. Please keep them safe.
        More users

        Notice that this whole flow has to be completed for each app user. So finally you will have data stored something like that:

        |User             |Access Token                            |Refresh Token                           |
        |-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
        |user1@domain.com |6c29bb64200ba868442b95cf16d14122ecd95816|c9fd39b05bdf01b233915b973e7efcdcb4993f3d|
        |user2@test.com   |011c945f30ce2cbafc452f39840f025693339c42|1c6637a8f2e1f75e06ff9984894d6bd16a3a36a9|

        (…)

        Now, when your application wants to perform any action in context of these any user, it has to use corresponding data (access_token, refresh_token).

        Lets say, your app user user2@test.com wants to add new advert, then your requests should look like this:
        ```
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ data }' -H "Authorization: Bearer 011c945f30ce2cbafc452f39840f025693339c42" "https://www.olx.pt/api/partner/adverts"
        ```
        Notice which token is used.

        Another case: application wants to fetch all threads of user1@domain.com:
        ```
        curl -X GET  -H "Authorization: Bearer 6c29bb64200ba868442b95cf16d14122ecd95816" "https://www.olx.pt/api/partner/threads"
        ```
        Same rule applies to all endpoints in OLX API.

        # Troubleshooting

        The aim of this section is to familiarise you with the possible errors that may appear during the development process or directly after launching the integration for the very first time.

        ## Error handling
        This API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the status of a response.

        |Name                   |Code|Description                                                                                                                                                    |

          "grant_type":"authorization_code"
          "scope":"read write v2"
          "client_id":"<your client_id>"

                  * Following characters cannot be provided in the title and in the description three times in a row: `!` `?` `.` `,` `-` `=` `+` `#` `%` `&` `@` `*` `_` `>` `<` `:` `(` `)` `|`
                  * The amount of capital letters in the title and in the ad description cannot be greater than 50% of a whole text.
                  * The title has to be at least 16 characters long and cannot be longer than 70 characters.
                  * The description has to be at least 80 characters long and cannot be longer than 9000 characters.
                  * E-mail addresses and phone numbers are not allowed in the title and in the description.
                  * Salary currency has to be written in uppercase (for example: `EUR` instead of `eur`).
                  * Lower or upper value of the salary cannot be greater than 99999999999999.

                ## Advert lifecycle

                  * Post new advert
                  * In response you will get current status of posted advert:
                    * if status is `limited` then you must buy packet for advert or category and activate advert (check out Packets section and Adverts section)
                    * if status is `new` then flow goes to point 3.
                  * Advert is awaiting for moderation. Usually it takes some seconds.
                    * if advert is accepted it will be activated automatically and visible for all users
                    * if advert is rejected (possible reasons: scam, illegal items offered etc)
                    * if advert is rejected but user can fix issues, and advert goes back to moderation
                  * Advert is active. How long advert will be valid is defined in field `valid_to` in advert response.
                  * When “valid to” date is passed, advert becomes outdated - user can activate advert again.

                  User can manually deactivate advert, status is set to `removed_by_user`. Deactivated advert can be activated again. To completly remove advert user should deactivate it at first and then delete it (check out Adverts section).

                  ## Advert statuses

                  * new: fresh advert before activation and moderation
                  * active: visible on OLX
                  * limited: advert exceeded limit of free adverts in selected category
                  * removed_by_user: manually removed by user
                  * outdated: advert reached expiration date
                  * unconfirmed: waiting for confirmation
                  * unpaid: waiting for payment
                  * moderated: negative moderation result
                  * blocked: blocked by moderation
                  * disabled: disabled by moderation, offer blocked and waiting for verification
                  * removed_by_moderator: removed by moderator

                  ## Posting Advert

                  To add an advert client have to send request to `/api/partner/adverts` endpoint.

                  This endpoint requires POST HTTP method, and expects data to be sent as JSON along with `Content-Type: application/json header`.

                  Remember to send `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN` and `Version: 2.0` headers either.

                  Using this endpoint creates advert in the name of currently authenticated user.

                  You must send all required fields (as it’s described in `/api/partner/adverts` endpoint reference), inlcuding required attributes.

                  For list of available categories, attributes, cities please check out appropriate endpoint references like `/api/partner/categories`, `/api/partner/cities` and so on.

                  You can get list of required attributes by `/api/partner/categories/ID/attributes` endpoint where ID is the category ID you choosed. Endpoint return list of required and optional attributes to create advert - attributes vary in different countries and categories.

                  Important: please note that attributes with type salary and price have different structures than normal attributes. For more details about those attributes please read Create advert endpoint description.

                  When some required fields are missing in response you will get a list of errors as a result:
                  ```
                  {

                  }

                  ```
                  If status is `new`, it’s mean that advert will be activated soon (after moderation process). But if status is `limited` you must perform two extra steps:

                  * buy “packet” for a single advert (check out `/api/partner/adverts/ID/packets`) or whole category (check out `/api/partner/users/me/packets`).
                  * activate advert (checkout `/api/partner/adverts/ID/commands` - `activate` command)

                  After some time (usually few seconds) advert should become `active` and be visible to all users.

                  You can `deactivate` active advert with deactivate command (checkout `/api/partner/adverts/ID/commands`). You can activate inactive advert with activate command.

                  If you want to completely `remove` advert please use `DEL /api/partner/adverts/ID/` endpoint.

                  You can buy extra paid features for active advert. For more details check out “Paid features” section.
